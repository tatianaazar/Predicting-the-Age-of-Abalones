# Predicting-the-Age-of-Abalones
This project uses the Abalone dataset to train a neural network to predict the age of the abalones using different features. 
A second model is built for comparison using an XGBoost model. 

This investigation uses a Neural Network to predict the age of abalones. The code can be found in the "NeuralNetworkModel" branch. 
It also uses an XGBoost model for a comparison. The code can be found in the "XGBoostModel" branch.

There is also a "Report" branch containing the full report and thorough investigation. 

These codes run on the Linux or Windows operating systems using the following commands: 
- pip3 installâ€“upgrade pandas
- pip3 install numpy pandas scikit learn 
- pip3 install tensorflow
- pip3 install seaborn
- pip3 install xgboost
- python3 <-filename->- .py
